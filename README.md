Hello and Welcome to Piano Pro!

Site Link: https://mdsparks17.github.io/580-Project/index.html

This app is designed for both Sighted and Blind people to hone their piano skills, including:
- Perfect Pitch Training
- Interval Training
- Chord Training
- Rhythm Training

You MUST use Google Chrome! (MIDI in browser is only supported by chrome)

While the site is designed to be navigable without the mouse, you have to click on the webpage to enable piano sounds. This is an inconveince that cannot be avoided.

This project was initially intended to be operated in conenction with an actual piano keyboard, but due to remote learning you will likely not have the pleasure of experiencing Perfect Pitch Training and Chord Training at their fullest. You will find Chord Training frustratingly hard to do on the computer keyboard, but rest assured it works. For student and proffesor testing use the computer keyboard or click on the piano element.
(if you are a super student and want to try it out you must install the correct driver for your piano to your computer and connect it up by USB, although drivers are often a fickle dark magic)

By the time you read this there should be access to the How-To guide. However, generally 'enter' is the instructions; 'awsedftjikol;' play notes on the keyboard, from C4 to C5; 'gh' change octave (move up and down the piano); 'm' gives you your score; 'space' starts the game mode. 

Games do not have an end, so go as long as your heart deisres and reach the highest streak you can! After all this is an edu-tainment app to be used in conjunction with other modes of piano learning.

**Working in MIDI is a bit buggy due to it being relitivly new in browser. I expect some buggyness from different environments. Feel free to include any and all frustrations in the git forums first, but for bizzaro problems please contact me at 704-477-7062, ESPECIALLY if the project is unplayable.
